# RubyGrams

#### By Bryce Bresnan <Bryce.Bresnan@gmail.com>

#### A project to demonstrate TDD in Ruby. Running the script will allow the user to select different word examining programs. Currently you can check to see if two words are Anagrams of one another. You can also select a palindrome checker that can tell if a word is a palindrome or not.
